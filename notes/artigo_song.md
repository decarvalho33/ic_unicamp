PQ NÃO DA PRA FICAR SÓ NA S288C:
- Genomics studies using the standard S288C yeast reference ge-
nome have produced many informative and interesting results [13]. However, our understand-
ing of yeast genetics and systems biology will widen and deepen if we can integrate new data
into a pan-genome model to account for a greater proportion of the genetic and phenotypic
variation exhibited by the global population of S. cerevisiae. A pan-genome is defined as the set
of all genes in a species [14], and can be constructed from the union of gene sets over all S. cerevisiae strains.

- To assign strain-specific functional annotations, we identi-
fied genes that were not present in the reference genome. We classified these according to
their presence or absence across strains and characterized each group of genes with
known functional and phenotypic features.


TRANSIÇÃO DE DADOS ENTRE PROCARIOTO PRA EUCARIOTO:
Pipelines for the pan-genome analysis of bacteria have been developed such as PGAP [15], but
these are not suitable for eukaryotic genomes, even for unicellular eukaryotes such as yeasts,
which exhibit more complex gene structures and non-genic regions than prokaryotes.
